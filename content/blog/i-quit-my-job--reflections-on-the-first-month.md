### The First Signs Something Was Wrong

For nearly a year before quitting, I struggled with consistency at work. I’d have bursts of high productivity for a few weeks, only to crash and find myself barely able to finish even the simplest tasks. I was actually struggling just to start working on them.

At first, I thought it was just a motivation issue. But eventually I realised it ran deeper — it had a lot to do with my emotional state, stress levels, and overall wellbeing.

I love what I do, and my job performance has always been tightly linked with how I feel in general. When I have productive, structured days, everything else seems to click: I exercise, eat well, sleep better, and spend quality time with my family.

But when work goes badly, it sets off a vicious cycle: worse sleep, worse eating, lower energy, less quality time with family, and even worse performance at work. It felt like everything was connected and falling apart at once.

Over time, my procrastination got worse. I’d catch myself staring at the screen for ages, unable to even start the simplest tasks. Once I finally broke through that barrier, I could work for hours with no problem — unless I got interrupted by calls or messages from colleagues. Then it was a struggle to start again.

It was becoming obvious I was burning out. One clear sign was that I stopped caring much about how the company performed. Before, I was invested and genuinely excited about our team and company goals. I used to focus hard on helping us achieve them. But as the burnout grew, my priorities shifted more toward simply protecting my own wellbeing.

On top of that, a wave of layoffs just made everything worse — adding uncertainty and killing morale.

### My Decision to Quit

In the end, I chose what might seem like an extreme solution: I quit.

There were other ways I could have tried to fix things, but it felt like the right time for a real reset. I’d been at a fast-paced startup for 3 years. The work was always urgent, but it had also become repetitive and not challenging enough, adding to my frustration.

One good thing that came out of this job is that I was able to save enough to give myself a one-year personal runway. I decided to use it to try something on my own. With the growing popularity of solo entrepreneurs and the rapid improvements in AI tools, my goal became to build something independently.

### The First Month After Quitting: Honest Reflections

It’s only been a month since I quit, but it already feels like a roller coaster. Here are some real wins and struggles.

### 🌧️ The Challenges

- I’ve spent too much time on other people’s priorities. I need to learn to say “no” more.

- I still lack structure and systems — even for downtime like watching movies.

- I’m struggling to slow down. I was so used to rushing all the time — getting my son to kindergarten, hitting the gym, starting work calls — always sprinting, always exhausted. I’m trying to unlearn that. Now I’m working on simple things like having meals without rushing.

### 🌤️ The Wins

- I’m slowly getting my motivation back. It feels exciting to learn new things again.

- I’ve started taking long walks with no phone or tech. They’ve been incredibly helpful. (One of these walks actually inspired this blog post.)

- I feel more in control of my future. That’s something I’d been missing for a while.

Overall, this month has been full of ups and downs, but I’ve genuinely enjoyed it. Next up: a proper summer vacation with my family.

After that, it’s building time. 🚀

See you soon.
