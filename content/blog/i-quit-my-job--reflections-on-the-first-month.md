### The First Signs Something Was Wrong

For nearly a year before quitting, I struggled with consistency at work. I’d have bursts of high productivity for a few weeks, only to crash and find myself barely able to finish the simplest tasks. Actually I was struggling to start working on the tasks.

At first, I thought it was just motivation. But eventually I realised it ran deeper — it had a lot to do with my emotional state, stress levels, and overall wellbeing.

My job performance has always been tightly linked with how I feel in general. When I have productive, structured days, everything else seems to click: I exercise, eat well, sleep better, and spend quality time with my family.

But when work goes badly, it sets off a vicious cycle: worse sleep, worse eating, lower energy, less time for family, and even worse performance at work. It felt like everything was connected and falling apart at once.

### My Decision to Quit

In the end, I chose what might seem like an extreme solution: I quit.

There were other ways I could have tried to fix things, but it felt like the right time for a real reset. I’d been at a fast-paced startup for 3 years. The work had become repetitive and not challenging enough, adding to my frustration.

The good thing that came out of this job is that I was able to save enough to give myself a 1 year personal runway so I decided to try something on my own. With the growing popularity of solo entrepreneurs and the improvements in the AI tools my goal became to try building something on my own.

### The First Month After Quitting: Honest Reflections

It’s only been a month since I quit, but it already feels like a roller coaster. Here are some real wins and struggles.

### 🌧️ The Challenges

- I’ve spent too much time on other people’s priorities. I need to learn to say “no” more.
- I still lack structure and systems — even for downtime like watching movies.
- I’m struggling to slow down. I was so used to rushing all the time — getting my son to kindergarten, hitting the gym, starting work calls — always sprinting, always exhausted. I’m trying to unlearn that. Now I’m working on simple things like having meals without rushing.

### 🌤️ The Wins

- I’m slowly getting my motivation back. It feels exciting to learn new things again.
- I’ve started taking long walks with no phone or tech. They’ve been incredibly helpful. (One of these walks actually inspired this blog post.)
- I feel more in control of my future. That’s something I’d been missing for a while.

Overall, this month has been full of ups and downs, but I’ve genuinely enjoyed it. Next up: a proper summer vacation with my family.

After that, it’s building time. 🚀

See you soon.
